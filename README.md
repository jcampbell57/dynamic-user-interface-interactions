# dynamic-user-interface-interactions

## Project info

This repo features the some of the projects that I completed while working through the javascript module of The Odin Project. These projects served as great practice for me while I was learning the language, and I intend to improve and refer to these examples in the future. I also used this repo as an opportunity to practice implementing webpack, linting and babel.
